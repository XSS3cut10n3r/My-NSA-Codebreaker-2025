## About the Challenge

The NSA Codebreaker Challenge provides students with a hands-on opportunity to develop their reverse-engineering and low-level code analysis skills while working on a realistic problem set centered around the NSA's mission.

The challenge consists of a series of tasks worth varying points based on difficulty. Tasks are strictly sequential and must be solved in order. Each task requires a range of skills including reverse engineering, network analysis, cryptography, binary analysis, and web application security.

## Scenario

This year's challenge involves assisting the NSA's Cyber Response Team in investigating suspicious activity detected by the Air Force's Security Operations Center. The scenario involves analyzing potential infiltration attempts by advanced foreign adversaries targeting military cyber operations.
