# NSA Codebreaker Challenge 2025 Writeups

My writeups and solutions for the NSA Codebreaker Challenge.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at the SANS Institute with a focus on cybersecurity. My interest in the field grew from wanting to understand how networks and computer systems operate at a fundamental level, which naturally led me to security. One of my highlights from this challenge was challenge 4, it introduced me to Malware Analysis and I learned a lot.

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Category |
|:-----|:-----|:--------:|
| [Task 1](./task1.md) | Getting Started | Forensics |
| [Task 2](./task2.md) | The Hunt Continues | Network Forensics |
| [Task 3](./task3.md) | Digging Deeper | Reverse Engineering |
| [Task 4](./task4.md) | Unpacking Insight | Malware Analysis |
| [Task 5](./task5.md) | Putting It All Together | Cryptanalysis |
| [Task 6](./task6.md) | Crossing the Channel | Vulnerability Research |
| [Task 7](./task7.md) | Finale | Vulnerability Research, Exploitation |

## About the Challenge

The NSA Codebreaker Challenge provides students with a hands-on opportunity to develop their reverse-engineering and low-level code analysis skills while working on a realistic problem set centered around the NSA's mission.

The challenge consists of a series of tasks worth varying points based on difficulty. Tasks are strictly sequential and must be solved in order. Each task requires a range of skills including reverse engineering, network analysis, cryptography, binary analysis, and web application security.

## Scenario

This year's challenge involves assisting the NSA's Cyber Response Team in investigating suspicious activity detected by the Air Force's Security Operations Center. The scenario involves analyzing potential infiltration attempts by advanced foreign adversaries targeting military cyber operations.
