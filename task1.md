# Task 1 - Getting Started (Forensics)

> You arrive on site and immediately get to work. The DAFIN-SOC team quickly briefs you on the situation. They have noticed numerous anomalous behaviors, such as: tools randomly failing tests and anti-virus flagging on seemingly clean workstations. They have narrowed in on one machine they would like NSA to thoroughly evaluate.

> They have provided a zipped EXT2 image from this development machine. Help DAFIN-SOC perform a forensic analysis on this - looking for any suspicious artifacts.
